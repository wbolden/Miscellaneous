Miscellaneous
=============

Assorted projects I did in 11th grade, not particularly good.

Bananas: Simple 2D physics game, two players take turns throwing bananas at each other

Card Shuffling: Shuffles a deck of cards repeatedly until it returns to its initial state (run in terminal)

Game of Life: A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life

Mandelbrot set - images: Generates png images of Mandelbrot set, will use up to 4 cpu cores

Mandelbrot set - interactive: Not multithreaded, though you can zoom in and move around

Phase transition: Displays a graph of the average number of connected nodes in a boolean network

Playfair Cipher: Encode and decode with playfair cipher (run in terminal)

Snake: A simple implementation of Snake

Zombies: A 2D zombie infection on a (badly) randomly generated map


Still looking for Ghost and 3D random walk, I'm puting these other projects on github so I dont lose track of them too.
